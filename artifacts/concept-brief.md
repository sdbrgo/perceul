## 🚩Problem Statement
Current workplace profiling metholodogies are still traditional in approach, think qualitative assessments, interviews, and analyses that are time-consuming.
While traditional methods prove rigor and analytical expertise, there remains opportunities for improvement in operational efficiency through modern 
technologies like AI and Machine Learning. PERCEUL establishes a multi-component, methodological system that integrates domain knowledge with automated processes, facilitating faster
interpretive and contextual generation of insights.

## 🟢System Functions (What It Does)
- Perception Modeling: PERCEUL ingests self-report data regarding workplace perception and ergonomics. Using psychological self-report tools, the system turns perception representations into diagnostic insights.
- Worker Profiling: PERCEUL surfaces workers' dominant cognitive sensitivities and strength points.
- Diagnostic & Decision Support: PERCEUL identifies real-world groupings of workers, allowing organizations to recognize their workforce's strengths and weakness.
Consequently, the system shows stakeholders the aspects of an organization that might influence worker comfort and performance.

## ⚠️System Limitations (What It Doesn't Do)
- PERCEUL requires domain knowledge from psychology and ergonomics. Technical processes are handled by internally by the system, but the system urges precise data gathering via validated instruments.
Ergonomics recommendations are also a key output of the system, thus it requires recommendations driven by ergonomic and safety principles.
- The system does not generate named groupings. Manual cluster interpretation is required to contextualize groups.
- The current framework is a prototype and is not integration-ready. It is optimizable for integration purposes.
